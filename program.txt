Our program will implement a text based game
We expect the program to have;
 -A object-oriented design
 -Approximately 10 different rooms
 -One boss
 -5 different items
 -3 different types of items
We expect the program to have approximately 500 lines
This program is a good illustration because the object-oriented approach
would showcase the language.
